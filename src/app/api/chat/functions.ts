		In both cases, you have to choose from the list of components based on the description and type of each element, and you will have to return the exact name. 
		The name of the component you return has to be the same as the name it has in the list. If the component is not on the list is because you don't need it. If you need to display lists, bolder text, a table, or code, just return text using markdown. If no special component is needed for the user input, you should choose the text_input.
